### About Me
My friends call me Thornathan as I used to have a nickname as Thorne for being the "Mob boss type guy that everyone went to for favors" such as homework or simply covering someone's lunch and Thornathan sounded a little better off the tongue.

I enjoy innovating websites to the most current technology and expanding to create scalable and captivating sites in a logical and creative path.

Programming is one of the most versatile and important skills a person can have in today's business world. It enables developers to craft programs unique to any business' specific needs thus facilitating that business' growth.

I view my self as a Problem Solver with a high interist in identifying Problems that arise. I have an empathic approach and creating logical solutions so I care deeply about creating a website or product that will bring the most out of a company. 

I am highly interested in working with a company that looks to take a chance on a young developer who is looking to make a name for himself and develop to become a Sr Developer that looks over developers who started where I am today.
